# ⚡ Google Workspace Automation Scripts  
*Turn your boring Google chores into one-click automations. Inbox, Drive, and Calendar… handled.*

## 👋 Hey, I’m Samih ([samih2shaikh](https://github.com/samih2shaikh))  
I’m a Computational Data Scientist who got sick of living inside Gmail and Drive tabs.  
So I started building little bots with **Google Apps Script** — bots that save me hours every week.  
Now, I’m sharing them with you.

## 🎯 The Problem (you’ll relate to at least one of these)

### Gmail struggles
- Forwarding the same client’s email to your team… every. single. time.  
- Manually saving 12 PDF invoices from Gmail every month (why are you still doing this?).  
- Missing a VIP email because it got buried under “50% off shoes!” spam.  

### Drive headaches
- Dumping files into “Untitled folder (27)” because you never organize properly.  
- Forgetting to un-share sensitive docs with ex-colleagues or clients.  
- Wasting 10 minutes hunting down attachments you *know* are in Drive somewhere.  

### Calendar chaos
- Manually creating Google Meet links from email threads that say “let’s meet at 3 pm.”  
- Forgetting deadlines because your inbox notification vanished.  
- Juggling too many invites without a quick summary of what’s coming up.  

### Notification overload
- Gmail notifications that ping you for junk but stay silent on critical emails.  
- Switching between apps just to stay updated on team submissions or forms.  
- Copy-pasting info from emails into Slack/WhatsApp like some unpaid middleman.

## ✅ The Solution
This repo is your **automation toolkit**.  
Every script solves a real “ugh, why am I doing this manually?” problem.  

- Auto-forward emails by rules (boss → team, invoices → finance)  
- Save attachments straight into Drive folders (no clicks, no downloads)  
- Get WhatsApp or Slack pings when VIPs email you  
- Auto-organize Drive and clean up permissions  
- Generate calendar events from keyword-triggered emails  
- Create digest reports from your inbox
